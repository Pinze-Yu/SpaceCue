When x0 is equal to 1: The function value is non-zero, and the derivative is 0, causing the iteration to stall.\n\nC.

We need to express h in terms of r and the given parameters R and H.\n\n3) The cone and cylinder share the same apex. If we draw a line from the apex to the point where the cylinder touches the cone, it forms a right-angled triangle. In this triangle, the height is H-h, the base is R-r, and the hypotenuse is the slant height of the cone.\n\n4) Using the similarity of triangles, we can write:\n\n   (H-h)/H = (R-r)/R\n\n   Cross multiplying, we get:\n\n   HR - Hr = RH - rH\n\n   Simplifying:\n\n   Hr = rH\n\n   h = r(H/R)\n\n5) Substituting this into the volume formula:\n\n   V = \u03c0r^2(rH/R) = (\u03c0H/R)r^3\n\n6) To maximize this, we differentiate with respect to r and set it to zero:\n\n   dV/dr = (3\u03c0H/R)r^2 = 0\n\n   This gives r = 0, which is not the maximum.
