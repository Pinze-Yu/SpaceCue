The attendants must be placed in such a way that they can see into each room from the doorways that connect two adjacent rooms.\n\nFor gallery plan (a), we can see that there are five rooms arranged in a straight line with four connecting doorways. Placing an attendant at each of the two middle doorways would allow supervision of all rooms. Therefore, two attendants are sufficient for plan (a).\n\nFor gallery plan (b), there are also five rooms, but the arrangement includes a middle room that connects to all other rooms. By placing one attendant at the doorway of the central room, all rooms can be supervised since the central room has a direct line of sight to all other rooms through the connecting doorways. Therefore, only one attendant is needed for plan (b).\n\nCombining the requirements for both plans, we need a total of two attendants for plan (a) and one attendant for plan (b). Since the question asks for the smallest number of attendants who can supervise all rooms in both plans, we need to consider the higher number of attendants required by either plan.

The edges not included in the spanning tree are the ones we need to consider for the fundamental cut sets.\n\nLet's analyze the edges not included in the spanning tree:\n\n- \\( e_1 \\) is not in the spanning tree. Removing \\( e_1 \\) would disconnect one vertex from the rest of the tree, so the cut set is \\( \\{e_1, e_8\\} \\).\n- \\( e_3 \\) is not in the spanning tree. Removing \\( e_3 \\) would disconnect one vertex from the rest of the tree, so the cut set is \\( \\{e_3, e_7\\} \\).\n- \\( e_5 \\) is not in the spanning tree. Removing \\( e_5 \\) would disconnect one vertex from the rest of the tree, so the cut set is \\( \\{e_5, e_7, e_8\\} \\).\n- \\( e_6 \\) is not in the spanning tree. Removing \\( e_6 \\) would disconnect one vertex from the rest of the tree, so the cut set is \\( \\{e_6, e_8\\} \\).\n\nThe edges \\( e_2 \\), \\( e_4 \\), and \\( e_7 \\) are part of the spanning tree, so they do not contribute to the fundamental cut sets in this context.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is the set of cut sets that includes all the edges not in the spanning tree and their corresponding cut sets:\n\n- \\( \\{e_1, e_8\\} \\)\n- \\( \\{e_3, e_7\\} \\)\n- \\( \\{e_5, e_7, e_8\\} \\)\n- \\( \\{e_6, e_8\\} \\)\n\nLooking at the provided options, the correct answer is:\n\nC: '\\({e_1, e_8}\\), \\({e_2, e_4, e_8}\\), \\({e_3, e_7}\\), \\({e_5, e_7, e_8}\\), \\({e_6, e_8}\\), \\({e_2, e_4}\\)'\n\nHowever, there is an error in this option as it includes \\({e_2, e_4}\\) and \\({e_2, e_4, e_8}\\), which should not be part of the fundamental cut sets since \\( e_2 \\) and \\( e_4 \\) are in the spanning tree. The correct fundamental cut sets should only include the edges not in the spanning tree. Therefore, none of the provided options exactly match the correct fundamental cut sets based on the images provided. If we ignore the incorrect inclusion of \\( e_2 \\) and \\( e_4 \\), option C is the closest to the correct answer."}

{"question": "Square $ABCD$ has side length $1$. Points $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ each lie on a side of $ABCD$ such that $APQCRS$ is an equilateral convex hexagon with side length $s$.

The line segments $AP$, $BP$, $CQ$, $DQ$, $AR$, and $DS$ are all equal in length because they are sides of equilateral triangles that share sides with the square $ABCD$. Let's denote the length of these segments as $x$.\n\nNow, consider the triangle $APB$. Since $AB$ is a side of the square with length $1$, and $AP$ and $PB$ are both $x$, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of $s$ (the side of the hexagon):\n\n\\[ s^2 = x^2 + x^2 - 2 \\cdot x \\cdot x \\cdot \\cos(120^\\circ) \\]\n\\[ s^2 = 2x^2 - 2x^2 \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{2}) \\]\n\\[ s^2 = 2x^2 + x^2 \\]\n\\[ s^2 = 3x^2 \\]\n\\[ s = x\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nNow, consider the right triangle formed by $AP$, $PD$, and $AD$. Since $AD$ is a side of the square, it has a length of $1$. The length of $PD$ is $1 - x$ because it is the remainder of the side $AD$ after subtracting $AP$.

Since $x = 0$ is not possible, we have $x = 1$. But this would imply that $s = AB$, which is not the case. We need to find the correct value of $x$ that satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n\nLet's correct the algebra:\n\n\\[ x^2 + (1 - x)^2 = 1 \\]\n\\[ x^2 + 1 - 2x + x^2 = 1 \\]\n\\[ 2x^2 - 2x + 1 = 1 \\]\n\\[ 2x^2 - 2x = 0 \\]\n\\[ x^2 - x = 0 \\]\n\\[ x(x - 1) = 0 \\]\n\nWe discard $x = 0$ and keep $x = 1$.
