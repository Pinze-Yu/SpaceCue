Their children (#3 and #4) each have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease allele from individual #1.\n\nHowever, since the spouses of #3 and #4 are not carriers, they each have two normal alleles.

Since #4 has a 50% chance of being a carrier (having inherited the disease allele from #1), and their spouse is not a carrier, individual #7 has a 50% chance of being a carrier but cannot be affected because it would require two copies of the disease allele to express the AR disease.\n\nTherefore, the probability that individual #7 will be affected by the disease is 0%, because they cannot inherit two copies of the disease allele under the given assumptions."}

The graph shows a baseline level of about 1 mg/mL, which is within the normal range, but the statement about homeostatic mechanisms maintaining this concentration is not specific enough to be considered correct without additional context.\n\nStatement II suggests that glucagon is released at points A and C, where the blood glucose level is starting to rise after a dip. Glucagon is indeed released when blood glucose levels are low to trigger the release of glucose into the bloodstream. The graph shows a rise in blood glucose levels after points A and C, which could indicate glucagon release.\n\nStatement III suggests that the individual eats a meal at point D. This is likely correct because there is a sharp increase in blood glucose levels immediately after point D, which is consistent with the ingestion of food.\n\nStatement IV suggests that insulin is being released at points B and E, where the blood glucose level is starting to decrease after a peak. Insulin is released in response to high blood glucose levels to facilitate the uptake of glucose by cells, lowering the blood glucose level.

(In the pedigree, open circles and squares indicate the mahogany phenotype; filled indicate red.)

According to the information provided, the mahogany/red locus is autosomal, with mahogany being dominant in males (heterozygous condition) and red being dominant in females (heterozygous condition). Homozygotes express the color of their respective alleles (mahogany or red).\n\nFrom the pedigree, we can infer the following:\n\n- Elmer is mahogany (open square), but since he has a red offspring (Elinor), he must be heterozygous for the mahogany/red gene (Mm).\n- Elmira is red (filled circle), and since she has a mahogany parent (Elmer), she must also be heterozygous (Mm).\n\nWhen Elmira is inseminated with Elmer's semen, the possible genotypes of the offspring can be determined by a Punnett square:\n\nElmer's alleles: M m\nElmira's alleles: M m\n\nThe possible genotypes for the offspring would be:\n\n- MM (mahogany)\n- Mm (mahogany if male, red if female)\n- mM (mahogany if male, red if female)\n- mm (red)\n\nSince we are looking for the probability of a mahogany female calf, we need to consider only the female offspring. The mahogany phenotype in females can only occur if they are homozygous (MM), which is not possible given the heterozygous condition of both parents. Therefore, all female calves will be red, either Mm or mm.\n\nHence, the probability that Elmira will produce a mahogany female calf is 0. Since this option is not listed, the closest answer would be the one that indicates impossibility or the lowest probability. In this case, the lowest probability listed is '1/16'.\n\nSo, the correct answer is E."}
