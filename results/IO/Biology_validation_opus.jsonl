This muscle is located deep in the posterior compartment of the leg, adjacent to the tibia and fibula bones. Its primary function is to flex the big toe. The tibialis anterior and posterior are more anteriorly located, while the peroneus longus is in the lateral compartment, so the deep posterior muscle labeled 170 most likely represents the flexor hallucis longus."}

{"question": "<image 1> If the pH outside the cell decreases, would you expect the amount of amino acids transported into the cell to increase or decrease?", "options": "['increase', 'decrease']", "correct_answer": "A", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"B\"}", "response_history": "B. decrease\n\nThe image shows a model of secondary active transport, where glucose is transported into the cell along its concentration gradient, and this process is coupled to the transport of sodium ions (Na+) into the cell against their concentration gradient.\n\nIf the pH outside the cell decreases, meaning the extracellular environment becomes more acidic, this will increase the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) outside the cell. The H+ ions will compete with the Na+ ions for binding to the transport proteins. \n\nWith more H+ ions occupying the transport proteins, fewer Na+ ions will be able to bind and be transported into the cell. Since the transport of amino acids into the cell is coupled to the Na+ gradient, a decrease in Na+ transport will consequently lead to a decrease in the amount of amino acids transported into the cell.\n\nTherefore, if the pH outside the cell decreases, the amount of amino acids transported into the cell is expected to decrease."}
{"question": "Name the most likely mode of inheritance in the following pedigree: <image 1>", "options": "['autosomal recessive (AR)', 'autosomal dominant (AD)', 'X-linked recessive (XR)', 'X-linked dominant (XD)']", "correct_answer": "B", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"A\"}", "response_history": "A. The most likely mode of inheritance in this pedigree is autosomal recessive (AR).\n\nReasoning:\n- Both males and females are affected, ruling out X-linked inheritance patterns (XR and XD).\n- The trait skips generations, with unaffected parents having affected children. This is inconsistent with autosomal dominant inheritance where an affected parent would pass the trait to about 50% of their children.\n- When two unaffected parents have an affected child, it suggests they are both carriers of a recessive allele. Their children have a 25% chance of inheriting both recessive alleles and being affected, consistent with the pedigree shown.\n\nTherefore, the inheritance pattern that best fits this pedigree is autosomal recessive (AR)."}

The sequence ALILALMWWLLF contains mostly hydrophobic amino acids like alanine (A), leucine (L), isoleucine (I), methionine (M), tryptophan (W), and phenylalanine (F). These nonpolar residues would allow this segment to embed into and span the membrane.\n\nIn contrast, the other options contain more polar and charged amino acids like lysine (K), aspartic acid (D), glutamine (Q), and serine (S). Charged and very polar residues are not commonly found in transmembrane helices as they are energetically unfavorable in the hydrophobic membrane environment. They are more likely to be found in extramembrane domains exposed to aqueous solution.\n\nTherefore, based on the high proportion of hydrophobic residues ideal for a transmembrane segment, ALILALMWWLLF (option A) is the most plausible sequence for part of the transmembrane domain of the channel protein ALPHA."}

{"question": "The primary disaccharide digestion product of starch is", "options": "['<image 1>', '<image 2>', '<image 3>', '<image 4>', '<image 5>']", "correct_answer": "C", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"D\"}", "response_history": "D\n\nThe primary disaccharide digestion product of starch is maltose, which has the chemical structure shown in image 4.\n\nStarch is a polysaccharide composed of long chains of glucose monomers connected by \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bonds, with occasional \u03b1-1,6 branching points. During digestion, the enzyme amylase breaks down starch by hydrolyzing these glycosidic bonds, releasing maltose (two glucose units connected by an \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bond) as the main disaccharide product.\n\nThe other images show different disaccharides or polysaccharides:\n\n1. Sucrose (glucose + fructose)\n2. Lactose (glucose + galactose) \n3. Cellobiose (two glucose units connected by a \u03b2-1,4 glycosidic bond, from cellulose)\n5. Amylopectin (a component of starch with \u03b1-1,4 and \u03b1-1,6 glycosidic bonds)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, maltose, the primary disaccharide produced from starch digestion."}
{"question": "Which feature(s) of this developing embryo are already established at the stage shown in <image 1>", "options": "['segmentation', 'head-tail orientation', 'limb placement', 'type of symmetry', 'limb placement and segmentation', 'segmentation, type of symmetry and head-tail orientation', 'segmentation, head-tail orientation and limb placement', 'type of symmetry and head-tail orientation', 'segmentation and head-tail orientation']", "correct_answer": "F", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"segmentation, type of symmetry and head-tail orientation\"}", "response_history": "F. The image shows a developing embryo with clear segmentation visible as the repeated body segments along the anterior-posterior axis. The head and tail ends are also distinguishable, indicating the head-tail orientation is established. However, at this early stage, limb buds have not formed yet in their proper locations. The embryo also exhibits bilateral symmetry, with mirrored left and right halves. Therefore, the features that are already present are segmentation, head-tail orientation, and bilateral symmetry, corresponding to the answer choice \"segmentation, type of symmetry and head-tail orientation\"."}
