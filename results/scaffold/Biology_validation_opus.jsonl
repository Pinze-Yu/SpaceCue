These show the glucose molecules being transported into the cell via a symporter protein that also transports sodium ions (Na+) at the same time.\n\nSymporters like this utilize the sodium gradient, with a high concentration of Na+ outside the cell and low concentration inside, to drive the transport of glucose or other molecules like amino acids against their concentration gradient. The sodium gradient is maintained by the sodium-potassium pump shown at coordinates (1.5) and (1.6).\n\nCrucially, the function of the sodium-potassium pump is dependent on pH. If the extracellular pH decreases and becomes more acidic, the pump function will be impaired. This will disrupt the sodium gradient the symporters rely on.\n\nWith a reduced sodium gradient, the symporters will not be able to efficiently transport glucose and amino acids into the cell against their gradients. Therefore, a decrease in extracellular pH is expected to decrease the amount of amino acids transported into the cell.\n\nSo in summary, I select option B - the amount of amino acids transported into the cell is expected to decrease."}

This allows the crow to quickly retrieve the cracked whelk after dropping it.\n\nIn contrast, Flight Path A has the crow dropping the whelk from a much greater height, as seen at coordinates (1,2) and (1,3). While this higher drop could potentially crack the whelk shell more effectively, it would be harder for the crow to visually track where the whelk lands. The other Flight Path A explanations about maximizing force or having a wider view are less relevant.\n\nTherefore, Flight Path B allowing the crow to easily see where the dropped whelk lands is the most logical explanation for the preferred whelk-eating behavior, making option B the best answer."}

Affected individuals (3, 4, 8, 9, 12, 15) have at least one affected parent, while unaffected individuals (5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19) have unaffected parents.\n\nWith autosomal dominant inheritance:\n- Affected individuals must have at least one dominant disease allele (A).\n- Unaffected individuals must have two recessive normal alleles (aa).\n\nLooking at Individual 9's parents:\n- Father (4) is affected, so his genotype must be Aa.\n- Mother (5) is unaffected and married into the family, so her genotype is aa.\n\nIndividual 9 is affected, inheriting one dominant allele (A) from the father and one recessive allele (a) from the mother. Therefore, Individual 9's genotype must be Aa.\n\nCoordinates (5,1) and (4,2) provide the key information about Individual 9's parents to determine the genotype.\n\nC. Aa"}
{"question": "In the Section of knee, identify the 164 structure. <image 1>", "options": "['Ligamentum patellae', 'Fibular collateral ligament', 'Tibial collateral ligament', 'Anterior cruciate ligament']", "correct_answer": "C", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"A\"}", "response_history": "The structure labeled 164 in the image corresponds to the Ligamentum patellae based on its location and appearance. The Ligamentum patellae is the ligament that connects the patella (kneecap) to the tibial tuberosity on the front of the tibia (shin bone). Therefore, the correct answer is A: Ligamentum patellae."}
{"question": "The primary disaccharide digestion product of starch is", "options": "['<image 1>', '<image 2>', '<image 3>', '<image 4>', '<image 5>']", "correct_answer": "C", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"B\"}", "response_history": "Based on the given images and question, the primary disaccharide digestion product of starch is maltose, which corresponds to image 2.\n\nReasoning:\nThe key structural features to identify maltose are:\n1. Two glucose units linked by an \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bond\n2. Reducing end with a free anomeric carbon and non-reducing end\n\nLooking at the annotated version of image 2, we can see:\n- The glycosidic linkage is between C1 of the left glucose (1,1) and C4 of the right glucose (2,4), indicating an \u03b1-1,4 bond\n- The right glucose has a free anomeric carbon at C1 (2,1), representing the reducing end\n\nTherefore, the structure in image 2 matches maltose, the primary disaccharide produced from starch digestion. The other images show different disaccharides or polysaccharides that do not result from starch breakdown.\n\nIn summary, the coordinates (1,1), (2,4) and (2,1) in image 2 confirm it depicts the maltose structure, so the correct answer is B."}
{"question": "Which feature(s) of this developing embryo are already established at the stage shown in <image 1>", "options": "['segmentation', 'head-tail orientation', 'limb placement', 'type of symmetry', 'limb placement and segmentation', 'segmentation, type of symmetry and head-tail orientation', 'segmentation, head-tail orientation and limb placement', 'type of symmetry and head-tail orientation', 'segmentation and head-tail orientation']", "correct_answer": "F", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"F\"}", "response_history": "Based on the image, the developing embryo shows clear segmentation along the anterior-posterior axis, indicating that segmentation and head-tail orientation are already established at this stage.\n\nThe relevant coordinates are (3,4), (4,4) and (5,4) which show distinct segments along the midline of the embryo. The color gradient from purple at (6,1) to green at (1,6) also suggests an established head-tail orientation.\n\nHowever, there are no visible limb buds or signs of bilateral symmetry yet.\n\nTherefore, from the given options, I select F: \"segmentation and head-tail orientation\" as the features that are already established in this embryo at the stage shown."}
