If the transition were instead from n=3 to n=1 (around coordinate (5.4, 1.4)), the energy difference would be greater.\n\nIn the Bohr model, the energy of emitted light is equal to the difference in energy levels. A larger energy difference corresponds to light with higher frequency and shorter wavelength, since E = h\u03bd and c = \u03bb\u03bd.\n\nTherefore, a transition from n=3 to n=1 would emit light with a higher frequency and shorter wavelength compared to the n=3 to n=2 transition shown.\n\nAmong the given options, A: 'lower frequency' and B: 'longer wavelength' are incorrect. C: 'greater speed' is irrelevant since the speed of light is constant. D: 'greater momentum' is correct, as higher frequency light has greater momentum (p = h/\u03bb).\n\nSo my answer is D."}

The direction of the induced current can be determined by Lenz's law, which states that the induced current will flow in a direction to oppose the change in magnetic flux.\n\nSince the magnetic field is decreasing, the induced current will flow in a direction to try to maintain the original magnetic field. This means the induced current will flow clockwise when viewed from the perspective shown in the diagram.\n\nTo calculate the magnitude of the induced current, we can use the equation:\n\u03b5 = -N * \u0394\u03a6/\u0394t\n\nWhere:\n\u03b5 = induced emf\nN = number of turns (1 in this case)\n\u0394\u03a6 = change in magnetic flux\n\u0394t = time over which the change occurs\n\nThe change in magnetic flux is given by:\n\u0394\u03a6 = B * A = 0.4 T * (0.5 m)^2 = 0.1 Wb\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\u03b5 = -1 * (-0.1 Wb) / 2 s = 0.05 V\n\nUsing Ohm's law, I = V/R, the induced current is:\nI = 0.05 V / 10^(-2) \u03a9 = 5 A\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 5 A, clockwise."}

To stabilize, it splits into Helium-4 and another lighter particle. Since the atomic number (number of protons) must be conserved in a nuclear reaction, the unknown particle must have a single proton to balance the equation.
