These points show the behavior of the function f1(x) = xe^(-x) around x = 1.\n\nAt (2,4), which corresponds to x slightly greater than 1, the function value is positive. As we move to the right to (3,4) and (4,4), the function remains positive but approaches zero.\n\nIn contrast, at (1,4), which is x slightly less than 1, the function value is negative.\n\nThis indicates that for starting points x0 > 1, the Newton-Raphson iteration will converge towards the solution at x = 1.
