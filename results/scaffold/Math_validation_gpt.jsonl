The man wants to minimize the time it takes to reach point Q from point P. He can row and walk at different speeds, so we need to find the optimal point R where he should stop rowing and start walking.\n\nThe relevant coordinates to consider for this problem are the points P, Q, and R, and the angle \u03b8. In the annotated image, these correspond to the coordinates (3,1) for P, (4,6) for Q, and (1,4) for R, with the angle \u03b8 at (3,2).\n\nThe total time T taken to reach Q from P via R can be expressed as the sum of the time taken to row from P to R and the time taken to walk from R to Q. Let's denote the distance PR as x and the distance RQ as y. The time to row is x/1.5 and the time to walk is y/3.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem and the fact that the radius of the lake is 1 mile, we can express x and y in terms of \u03b8:\n\nx = 1 * sin(\u03b8)\ny = 1 + 1 * cos(\u03b8)\n\nThe total time T is then:\n\nT = (1 * sin(\u03b8))/1.5 + (1 + 1 * cos(\u03b8))/3\n\nTo minimize T, we need to find the derivative of T with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero. However, since we are given options, we can check which of the given angles yields the minimum time without performing the actual differentiation.\n\nThe options given are:\n\nA. \u03b8 = \u03c0/2\nB. \u03b8 = \u03c0/3\nC. \u03b8 = \u03c0\nD. \u03b8 = 2\u03c0\n\nWe can eliminate options C and D immediately because they are outside the range \\(0 < \\theta < \\pi/2\\). Between options A and B, we can reason that if \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, the man would row directly to the opposite point on the shore, which is not optimal since walking is faster. Therefore, he should row at an angle less than \u03c0/2 to minimize the time.\n\nThe correct answer is B, \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, because this angle allows the man to take advantage of both his rowing and walking speeds in the most efficient way, given the constraints of the problem."}

The key is to find the relationship between the side length of the square and the side length of the hexagon.\n\nThe most relevant coordinates to look at are the points where the hexagon touches the square, which are the points P, Q, R, and S. Specifically, we can focus on the coordinates (1,2) for point P and (3,6) for point Q, as these will help us determine the length of the side of the hexagon.\n\nSince the square has a side length of 1, and APQCRS is an equilateral hexagon inscribed in the square, we can deduce that the length of AP and AS must be equal to the side length of the hexagon, s. The same applies to the other sides of the hexagon.\n\nLet's consider triangle APB. Since APQCRS is an equilateral hexagon, angle APB must be 120 degrees. Triangle APB is an isosceles triangle with AP = PB = s and AB = 1. We can drop a perpendicular from P to AB, dividing the isosceles triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the lengths of the sides opposite the 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 angles is 1:\u221a3:2. Therefore, if we let the length of the perpendicular be h, we have:\n\nh = s * (1/2)\nAB/2 = s * (\u221a3/2)\n\nSince AB = 1, AB/2 = 1/2. Therefore:\n\n1/2 = s * (\u221a3/2)\ns = (1/2) / (\u221a3/2)\ns = 1/\u221a3\ns = \u221a3/3\n\nHowever, this value of s is not in the list of options provided. We need to rationalize the denominator:\n\ns = (\u221a3/3) * (\u221a3/\u221a3)\ns = \u221a3 * \u221a3 / 3\ns = 3/3\ns = 1\n\nThis result seems incorrect because it suggests that the side length of the hexagon is equal to the side length of the square, which is not possible given the geometry of the figure. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\nWe know that the side length of the square is 1, and we need to find the side length s of the hexagon. The hexagon is equilateral, which means all its sides are equal in length. The side length of the hexagon is also the length of the segments AP, BP, BQ, CQ, CR, and DR.\n\nLet's look at triangle APB again. We know that angle APB is 120 degrees because the hexagon is equilateral. The triangle APB is isosceles with AP = PB = s and AB = 1. We can drop a perpendicular from P to AB, which will bisect AB and create two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the length of the side opposite the 30\u00b0 angle is half the length of the hypotenuse, and the length of the side opposite the 60\u00b0 angle is \u221a3/2 times the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, if we let the length of the perpendicular be h, we have:\n\nh = s * (\u221a3/2)\nAB/2 = s/2\n\nSince AB = 1, AB/2 = 1/2. Therefore:\n\ns/2 = 1/2\ns = 1\n\nThis result is still incorrect because it suggests that the side length of the hexagon is equal to the side length of the square, which is not possible given the geometry of the figure. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's re-evaluate the problem once more.\n\nWe need to find the length of the segment AP, which is the same as the side length s of the hexagon. We can use the fact that the hexagon is equilateral and the square has a side length of 1 to find s.\n\nLet's consider the right triangle formed by the perpendicular from P to AB and the segments AP and PB. The length of PB is 1 - s because PB is part of the side of the square, and the entire side AB is 1. The perpendicular from P to AB bisects AB, so the length of the segment from the foot of the perpendicular to B is 1/2.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle, we have:\n\n(AP)^2 = (PB)^2 + (1/2)^2\ns^2 = (1 - s)^2 + (1/2)^2\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\ns^2 = 1 - 2s + s^2 + 1/4\n0 = 1 - 2s + 1/4\n2s = 1 + 1/4\n2s = 5/4\ns = 5/8\n\nThis result is not in the list of options provided, which means we have made another mistake.
