The induced current will therefore create a magnetic field that opposes this change, attempting to maintain the original magnetic flux.\n\nSince the north pole of the magnet is facing the loop, the magnetic field lines are going from the north to the south pole, entering the loop from the right and exiting from the left.

The maximum kinetic energy (K) of the photoelectrons is determined by the energy of the incident photons minus the work function of the material. According to the photoelectric effect, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is directly proportional to the frequency of the incident light, provided the frequency is above the threshold frequency.\n\nThe relationship between the maximum kinetic energy (K) and the frequency of the incident light (f) is given by Einstein's photoelectric equation:\n\n\\[ K = h(f - f_0) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( K \\) is the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons,\n- \\( h \\) is Planck's constant,\n- \\( f \\) is the frequency of the incident light,\n- \\( f_0 \\) is the threshold frequency (the minimum frequency required to emit electrons).\n\nFrom the equation, we can see that the kinetic energy increases linearly with the frequency of the incident light once the threshold frequency is surpassed. Before the threshold frequency, the kinetic energy is zero because no electrons are emitted.\n\nLooking at the provided graphs:\n- Graph A shows a linear increase with no threshold, which is incorrect.\n- Graph B shows a decrease with increasing frequency, which is incorrect.\n- Graph C shows a curve that increases at an increasing rate, which is incorrect.\n- Graph D shows a linear relationship starting from a non-zero point on the frequency axis, which suggests a threshold frequency.\n\nThe correct graph should show a linear relationship starting from a threshold frequency on the frequency axis. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD"}
