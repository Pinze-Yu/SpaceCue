If we place an attendant at the central doorway, they can supervise the two rooms on either side. However, we still need to cover the two outermost doorways to supervise the rooms at the ends. Therefore, we need at least two attendants for plan (a).\n\nFor plan (b), there are also five doorways connecting the rooms. Similarly, placing an attendant at the central doorway allows supervision of the two central rooms. However, unlike plan (a), the layout of plan (b) allows the central attendant to also supervise the two rooms at the ends through the doorways that are perpendicular to the central doorway. This means that only one attendant is needed for plan (b).\n\nConsidering both plans, the smallest number of attendants required to supervise all rooms in the most efficient manner would be the larger number needed for either plan.

The correct option would be the one that subtracts f(x) from b, not adds it, and does not include g(x) since g(x) is not part of the boundaries of the shaded region.\n\nThe correct option is:\n\n\u222b from 0 to a of (b - f(x)) dx\n\nThis matches with option C: '$\\int_{0}^{a}\\left[b-g(x)-f(x)\\right]d x$', which is incorrect because it includes g(x), which should not be part of the calculation for the shaded area.\n\nThe correct integral should only involve b and f(x), but none of the options provided exactly match the correct integral. However, since I must choose from the given options, I will select the one that most closely resembles the correct integral by ignoring the incorrect inclusion of g(x).\n\nTherefore, the answer is C, with the understanding that g(x) should not be included in the integral for the shaded area."}

A Cayley diagram is a graph that represents the structure of a group in abstract algebra, with nodes (or vertices) representing group elements and directed, colored edges corresponding to group operations. The diagram in the image is consistent with the characteristics of a Cayley diagram, as it appears to represent a group with two generating elements (indicated by the two different colors of the edges) and the directed edges suggest the operation of the group. Therefore, the image is a Cayley diagram."}

This means that the angles at points $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are each 120 degrees. The square $ABCD$ has side length $1$, and we need to find the side length $s$ of the hexagon.\n\nLet's focus on triangle $APB$. Since $AP = PB = s$, and angle $APB$ is 120 degrees, triangle $APB$ is an isosceles triangle with one angle of 120 degrees. We can draw a perpendicular from $P$ to $AB$, let's call the foot of this perpendicular $M$. Now, triangle $APM$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, with $PM$ being $\\frac{s}{2}$ (because $APM$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides opposite the 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 angles is 1:\u221a3:2).\n\nThe length $AM$ is half the side of the square minus the small segment $PM$, which is $\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{s}{2}$. Since $AM$ is part of a 30-60-90 triangle, we know that $AM = PM \\cdot \\sqrt{3}$. So we have:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{s}{2} = \\frac{s}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}$$\n\nSolving for $s$, we get:\n\n$$1 - s = s \\cdot \\sqrt{3}$$\n$$1 = s \\cdot (\\sqrt{3} + 1)$$\n$$s = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} + 1}$$\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n$$s = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} + 1} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$$\n$$s = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{2}$$\n\nNow, we need to find which of the given options matches this expression. The expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{2}$ simplifies to $2 - \\sqrt{2}$ when we consider that $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$ and thus $\\sqrt{3} - 1 \\approx 0.732$, which when halved gives approximately $0.366$. This is close to the decimal approximation of $2 - \\sqrt{2}$, which is approximately $0.414$. None of the given options exactly match this, but the closest one is $2 - \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC) $2-\\sqrt{2}$"}
