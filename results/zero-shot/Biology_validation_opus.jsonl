The image shows a cell membrane with amino acid transporters that use a sodium (Na+) gradient to transport amino acids into the cell. This is an example of secondary active transport.\n\n2.

If the pH outside the cell decreases, that means the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) increases in the extracellular fluid. \n\n4. A lower pH (more acidic environment) outside the cell would disrupt the sodium gradient. The excess hydrogen ions would tend to flow into the cell, decreasing the net positive charge outside.\n\n5. With a reduced sodium gradient, the amino acid transporters would not be able to bring amino acids into the cell as effectively.

The other options can be eliminated:\n   - Flagellum is a long, whip-like structure used for movement, not present here.\n   - Nucleus is the large, round organelle labeled C.\n   - Cell wall is not found in animal cells, only in plant, fungal and bacterial cells.\n   - Cytoplasm is the gel-like substance filling the cell, not a specific structure.\n   - Mitochondria are the oval-shaped organelles scattered in the cytoplasm.\n   - Centrioles are small structures involved in cell division, not visible at this magnification.\n\nTherefore, the part of the cell labeled 'B' is most likely the Plasma membrane.\n\nIn summary, B is the correct answer - the Plasma membrane."}
{"question": "What is the coefficient of relatedness between individuals A and B in <image 1>?", "options": "['3/8', '5/8', '1/4', '1/2', '3/4']", "correct_answer": "A", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"3/8\"}", "response_history": "Let's analyze the pedigree step by step to determine the coefficient of relatedness between individuals A and B:\n\n1. A and B share a common ancestor, which appears to be B's grandparent and A's parent.\n\n2. The coefficient of relatedness between a grandparent and grandchild is 1/4, as there are two generations separating them, and the probability of sharing an allele is halved each generation.\n\n3. The coefficient of relatedness between a parent and child is 1/2, as there is only one generation separating them.\n\n4. To calculate the coefficient of relatedness between A and B, we need to find the average of their individual relatedness to the common ancestor.\n\n5. Coefficient of relatedness between A and B = (1/2 + 1/4) / 2 = 3/8\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: the coefficient of relatedness between individuals A and B is 3/8."}

The image shows a cross-section of the posterior abdominal region, with various organs and structures labeled with numbers.\n\n2. Structure 112 appears to be a small, round structure located above a larger, bean-shaped structure (likely the kidney).\n\n3. Given its location just above the kidney, structure 112 is most likely the adrenal gland, also known as the suprarenal gland.\n\n4. Looking at the provided answer choices, \"Suprarenal gland\" matches this identification.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Suprarenal gland."}
{"question": "Which image of the human heart muscle was produced by fluorescent microscopy?", "options": "['<image 1>', '<image 2>', '<image 3>']", "correct_answer": "C", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"B\"}", "response_history": "Let's analyze each image to determine which one was likely produced by fluorescent microscopy:\n\nImage 1: This image shows a histological section of cardiac muscle tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E stain). The purple color comes from hematoxylin staining cell nuclei, while the pink is eosin staining cell cytoplasm and extracellular matrix. This is a standard light microscopy staining technique, not fluorescence.\n\nImage 2: The green and red colors in this image are characteristic of fluorescent labeling. The tubular structures resemble blood vessels. The red dots could be nuclei stained with a red fluorescent dye like propidium iodide, while the green is likely a fluorescent antibody labeling the vessels. This multiplex fluorescent labeling is a strong sign of fluorescence microscopy.\n\nImage 3: The spectrum of colors from blue to red spanning the image is a hallmark of spectral imaging, where different wavelengths are assigned colors to visualize data. However, this does not appear to be fluorescence. The filamentous structures suggest this may be a second harmonic generation image of collagen fibers, another advanced microscopy technique.\n\nIn conclusion, image 2 exhibits the clear signs of fluorescence microscopy - distinct red and green fluorescent labels on biological structures. Therefore, B is the correct answer."}

{"question": "Consider the following plasmid, pET28a, a popular expression vector that is used for protein expression in bacteria: <image 1>. You freshly purified plasmid from overnight bacterial culture using extraction kit, also known as miniprep. You confirmed the quality of plasmids by checking DNA and protein ratio (A260/280) and running them on a DNA agarose gel. They looked pure as they should be. You would now like to digest this vector for gene manipulation (molecular cloning) to generate vectors suitable for molecular cloning. If you cut the above plasmid with restriction enzyme called HindIII, the form of DNA will be changed from _________", "options": "['Linear to supercoiled', 'Nicked to linear', 'Nicked to supercoiled', 'Supercoiled to nicked', 'Supercoiled to linear']", "correct_answer": "E", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"E\"}", "response_history": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The plasmid pET28a shown in the image is a circular DNA molecule. Circular DNA can exist in different topological forms, including supercoiled, nicked, and linear.\n\n2. The question states that the plasmid was freshly purified from an overnight bacterial culture using a miniprep kit. Plasmid DNA isolated from bacterial cells is typically in the supercoiled form, which is the most compact and stable form.\n\n3. The restriction enzyme HindIII is then used to digest the plasmid. HindIII is a type II restriction endonuclease that recognizes a specific 6 base pair sequence (A^AGCTT) and makes a double-stranded cut at that site.\n\n4. Looking at the plasmid map, there is a single HindIII site present in pET28a.\n\n5. When a supercoiled plasmid is cut by a restriction enzyme at a single site, it results in the linearization of the plasmid. The supercoiled DNA is converted into a linear DNA molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: Supercoiled to linear."}

The pedigree shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Affected individuals (shaded) have at least one affected parent, and both males and females are affected.\n\n2. Individual 9 is unaffected (unshaded). Since the disease allele is dominant, Individual 9 must have two normal alleles to be unaffected.\n\n3. The normal allele can be represented as \"A\" and the disease-causing allele as \"a\". \n\n4. For Individual 9 to be unaffected, their genotype must be \"AA\". They cannot have the genotype \"Aa\" as they would show the disease phenotype due to the dominant nature of the disease allele.\n\n5.
