As the conducting loop is pulled away from the magnet to the right, the magnetic flux through the loop decreases.\n\n2.

To counteract the decreasing flux, the induced current must create a magnetic field that points in the same direction as the original magnetic field from the magnet.\n\n3. Using the right-hand rule, we can determine that for the induced magnetic field to point to the right (same as the magnet's field), the induced current in the loop must flow counterclockwise when viewed from the right side.\n\n4.

The work function is the minimum energy required to eject an electron from the material's surface.

On the graph, this threshold frequency is the x-intercept, where the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is zero. At this point, the photon energy is just enough to overcome the work function, with no excess energy for the kinetic energy of the ejected electron.\n\n3. Extending the line to the x-axis, we see the x-intercept is approximately at a frequency of 5 \u00d7 10^14 Hz.\n\n4. To convert frequency to energy, we use the equation E = hf, where h is Planck's constant (4.14 \u00d7 10^-15 eV\u22c5s) and f is the frequency.\n\n5.

The graph shows the variation of the strong nuclear force with distance between nucleons. The force is plotted on the y-axis, and the distance is plotted on the x-axis.\n\n2. Point A corresponds to a very small separation between nucleons. At this point, the force is positive, indicating a repulsive force. This is because when nucleons are brought too close together, the strong force becomes repulsive due to the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n3. As the separation increases, the force becomes negative (attractive) and reaches a minimum at point B. This is the typical attractive nature of the strong nuclear force that binds nucleons together in the nucleus.\n\n4. Points C and D correspond to larger separations where the force gradually approaches zero. At these distances, the strong nuclear force is no longer effective.\n\nTherefore, point A shows the repulsive nature of the strong nuclear force at very small nucleon separations."}

In the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, electrons can only exist in specific energy levels (n=1, 2, 3, etc.). \n\n2.

As the magnetic field is decreasing, according to Faraday's law of induction, an emf will be induced in the loop.

The direction of the induced current is given by Lenz's law, which states that the induced current will flow in a direction so as to oppose the change causing it.
