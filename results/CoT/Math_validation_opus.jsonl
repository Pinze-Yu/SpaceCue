The main concept involved is the greatest integer function [x], which gives the largest integer less than or equal to x. We need to find the limit of this function as x approaches 2.\n\n2. A key property of the greatest integer function is that it has jump discontinuities at integer values. The function is constant between two consecutive integers and jumps at each integer value.\n\n3. Looking at the graph in Fig. 6-1, we see that the function has a constant value of 1 for x values between 1 and 2 (not including 2). At x=2, the function jumps to a value of 2.\n\n4. Assessing the options:\n   A) 1 - This is the value of [x] as x approaches 2 from the left, but not the limit at x=2.\n   B) 2 - At exactly x=2, [x] jumps to a value of 2. However, for a limit to exist, the left and right hand limits must be equal.\n   C) Not exist - For the limit to exist, the left and right hand limits must be equal. But here, the left hand limit is 1 (as x approaches 2 from values less than 2) while the right hand limit is 2 (as x approaches 2 from values greater than 2). Since these are not equal, the limit does not exist at x=2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: The limit of [x] as x approaches 2 does not exist, because the left and right hand limits are not equal at x=2 due to the jump discontinuity of the greatest integer function at integer values."}

The main concepts are graph theory and optimization. The floor plans can be represented as graphs, with rooms as nodes and doorways as edges.\n\n2. In graph theory, the minimum number of nodes that cover all edges is known as the vertex cover. Finding the minimum vertex cover is an optimization problem that can be formulated as an integer program.\n\n3. For each floor plan, we set up binary decision variables for each doorway, with 1 indicating an attendant is placed there and 0 otherwise. The objective is to minimize the total number of attendants used.\n\nConstraints ensure that for each room, at least one of its adjacent doorways has an attendant. This guarantees all rooms are supervised.\n\n4. Solving the integer programs using the simplex method:\n\n(a) Minimum of 1 attendant needed. Placing them in either the left or right doorway between the two rooms covers all rooms.\n\n(b) Minimum of 2 attendants needed. One must be placed in the central vertical doorway, and one in either the top or bottom horizontal doorway.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 2 attendants. This is the smallest number that can supervise all rooms based on the integer programming formulation and solving via the simplex method.

The main concepts involved are spanning trees and breadth-first search in graph theory. A spanning tree is a subgraph that includes all vertices of the original graph in a tree structure.

In a breadth-first spanning tree, the tree is constructed by exploring all the neighbors of the starting node, then the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on, layer by layer. This results in a tree that spans the graph with the shortest paths from the starting node to every other node.\n\n3.

We need to approximate f(0.6) using a step size of 0.8.\n\nFrom x = -1 to x = -0.2, the step size of 0.8 covers this in one step:\nf(-0.2) \u2248 f(-1) + 0.8 * f'(-1) = 1.5 + 0.8 * 1 = 2.3\n\nFrom x = -0.2 to x = 0.6, again one step:\nf(0.6) \u2248 f(-0.2) + 0.8 * f'(-0.2) = 2.3 + 0.8 * (-0.5) = 1.9\n\nTherefore, using Euler's method with step size 0.8, starting from x = -1, the approximation for f(0.6) is 1.9.\n\nA: 1.9\n\nThis is the correct answer based on applying Euler's method with the given derivative values and step size."}
{"question": "Square $ABCD$ has side length $1$. Points $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ each lie on a side of $ABCD$ such that $APQCRS$ is an equilateral convex hexagon with side length $s$.

The main concepts are the geometry of a square and an equilateral hexagon inscribed within it. The key information is that the square has side length 1 and we need to find the side length s of the hexagon.\n\n2. Relevant geometric principles that could help solve this include properties of equilateral triangles, squares, and trigonometry.\n\n3. Looking at the diagram, we can see that the hexagon divides the square into 6 equilateral triangles and a smaller square in the center. The side length of the hexagon is the same as the side length of these equilateral triangles.\n\n4. Let's assess each answer option:\n\nA) $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$: This looks promising. In an equilateral triangle with side length s, the height is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s$. If this height plus s equals the side length of the square (1), then $s + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s = 1$. Solving this gives $s = \\frac{2}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2}{3+\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3-\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2(3-\\sqrt{3})}{9-3} = \\frac{6-2\\sqrt{3}}{6} = 1-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$ (rationalizing the denominator in the last step). So this checks out.\n\nB) $\\frac{1}{2}$: This is not correct, as it would make the hexagon too large to fit inside the unit square.\n\nC) $2-\\sqrt{2}$: This is also too large, as $2-\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.586 > \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nD) $1-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$: Again, too large, as $1-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\approx 0.646 > \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nE) $\\frac{2}{3}$: Close, but not quite right. The correct answer has an additional factor of $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: $s = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$. This result follows from the geometric constraint that the height of the equilateral triangle plus its side length must equal the side length of the square."}
