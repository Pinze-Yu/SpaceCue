If the resistance changes in one part, it affects the entire circuit.\n- In a parallel circuit, the voltage is the same across all branches. Each branch can be analyzed independently.\n- The brightness of a bulb depends on the current flowing through it. More current results in a brighter bulb.\n\nAnalyzing the circuit diagram:\n- Bulbs 1, 2 and 3 are connected in series on the left branch.\n- Bulb 4 is on its own parallel branch on the right.\n- When the switch is closed, it creates a parallel path for current, reducing the total resistance.\n\nAssessing the options:\nA. Bulb 1 will get brighter, but it's not the only one affected.\nB. Bulb 2 will get brighter, but not just bulb 2.\nC. Bulbs 2 and 3 will both get brighter since they are in series, but bulb 1 is also in that series path.\nD. Correct. When the switch is closed, the total resistance decreases. This increases the current through the left branch containing bulbs 1, 2 and 3 in series, making them all brighter.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Bulbs #1, #2, and #3 will all become brighter when the switch is closed and bulb 4 lights up. The parallel branch with bulb 4 decreases the total resistance, allowing more current through the series branch containing the other three bulbs."}

The diagram shows a transition from n=3 to n=2. The question asks about a transition from n=3 to n=1 instead.\n\n4. Assessing the options:\n   A) Lower frequency: The energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency (E=hf). A larger energy difference between levels would result in a higher frequency photon, not lower.\n   B) Longer wavelength: Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency (c=\u03bbf). A higher frequency photon has a shorter wavelength, not longer.\n   C) Greater speed: All photons travel at the speed of light regardless of their energy or frequency.\n   D) Greater momentum: The momentum of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency (p=h/\u03bb). A larger energy transition would emit a higher frequency photon with greater momentum.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D - a transition from n=3 to n=1 would emit a photon with greater momentum compared to the n=3 to n=2 transition, because the larger energy difference corresponds to a higher frequency and thus greater momentum."}
