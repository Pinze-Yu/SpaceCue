{"question": "<image 1> If the pH outside the cell decreases, would you expect the amount of amino acids transported into the cell to increase or decrease?", "options": "['increase', 'decrease']", "correct_answer": "A", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"B\"}", "response_history": "Based on the information provided in the image, I would expect the amount of amino acids transported into the cell to decrease if the pH outside the cell decreases.\n\nReasoning: The image shows a plasma membrane with transport proteins (coordinates 5-8) that allow amino acids (yellow hexagons) to enter the cell from the extracellular fluid. The presence of Na+ ions (red circles) in the extracellular fluid suggests that this amino acid transport is coupled to the sodium gradient.\n\nIf the pH outside the cell decreases, it means the concentration of H+ ions increases in the extracellular fluid. This increased H+ concentration can disrupt the sodium gradient that drives the amino acid transport. With a reduced sodium gradient, the transport proteins will be less effective at bringing amino acids into the cell, resulting in a decrease in amino acid uptake.\n\nTherefore, my answer is B - the amount of amino acids transported into the cell would decrease if the extracellular pH decreases."}
{"question": "Name the most likely mode of inheritance in the following pedigree: <image 1>", "options": "['autosomal recessive (AR)', 'autosomal dominant (AD)', 'X-linked recessive (XR)', 'X-linked dominant (XD)']", "correct_answer": "B", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"C\"}", "response_history": "Based on the pedigree provided, the most likely mode of inheritance is X-linked recessive (XR). Here is my reasoning:\n\nThe key coordinates that support an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern are:\n- (6,10): Affected male offspring from unaffected parents\n- (14,15): Affected male offspring from an unaffected father and carrier (heterozygous) mother\n- (2,3), (7,11), (8,12): Unaffected female offspring who are likely carriers, having an affected father\n\nIn an X-linked recessive condition, males are more commonly affected than females because they only have one X chromosome. If they inherit the recessive mutation on their single X, they will be affected. Females with one mutated copy are typically unaffected carriers.\n\nThe pedigree shows affected males born to unaffected parents, which is consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance where the mother is an asymptomatic carrier. There is no male-to-male transmission, further supporting X-linkage.\n\nTherefore, considering the transmission pattern and overrepresentation of affected males, the most likely mode of inheritance is C: X-linked recessive (XR)."}

The anterior cruciate ligament runs diagonally through the center of the knee joint, connecting the femur (thigh bone) to the tibia (shin bone). Therefore, the correct answer is D: Anterior cruciate ligament."}
{"question": "The primary disaccharide digestion product of starch is", "options": "['<image 1>', '<image 2>', '<image 3>', '<image 4>', '<image 5>']", "correct_answer": "C", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"B\"}", "response_history": "The primary disaccharide digestion product of starch is maltose, which is represented by the structure shown in image 2.\n\nReasoning:\nLooking at the annotated version of image 2, the key structural features are:\n- Two glucose units linked by an O at positions 6 and 10\n- The linkage is an \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic bond, as evidenced by the equatorial OH at position 6 of the left glucose\n\nThis matches the structure of maltose, the primary product of starch digestion by the enzyme \u03b1-amylase. The other options show:\n\n1) Sucrose (glucose-fructose disaccharide)\n3) Cellobiose (glucose-glucose disaccharide with \u03b2-1,4 linkage) \n4) Isomaltose (glucose-glucose disaccharide with \u03b1-1,6 linkage)\n5) Acarbose (not a natural disaccharide)\n\nTherefore, the structure in image 2 best represents the main disaccharide product from the enzymatic breakdown of starch. My answer is B."}
{"question": "Which feature(s) of this developing embryo are already established at the stage shown in <image 1>", "options": "['segmentation', 'head-tail orientation', 'limb placement', 'type of symmetry', 'limb placement and segmentation', 'segmentation, type of symmetry and head-tail orientation', 'segmentation, head-tail orientation and limb placement', 'type of symmetry and head-tail orientation', 'segmentation and head-tail orientation']", "correct_answer": "F", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"F\"}", "response_history": "Based on the image, I can see that the developing embryo exhibits segmentation along the anterior-posterior axis (coordinates 1-16), indicating that head-tail orientation and segmentation are already established at this stage.\n\nThe embryo also shows bilateral symmetry, with mirrored left and right halves (comparing coordinates 1-8 to 9-16).\n\nHowever, there is no clear evidence of limb placement or development yet in this early embryonic stage.\n\nTherefore, from the given options, I would select F: \"segmentation, type of symmetry and head-tail orientation\" as the features that are already established in this embryo at the stage shown."}
