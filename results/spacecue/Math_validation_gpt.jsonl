The wave completes one full cycle between x = -\u03c0/2 and x = \u03c0/2, which is a length of \u03c0.

The total time T taken to reach point Q is the sum of the time taken to row to point R and the time taken to walk from R to Q.\n\nLet's denote the distance PR (the rowing distance) as x and the distance RQ (the walking distance) as y.

{"question": "Square $ABCD$ has side length $1$. Points $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ each lie on a side of $ABCD$ such that $APQCRS$ is an equilateral convex hexagon with side length $s$. What is $s$? <image 1>", "options": "['$\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{3}$', '$\\\\frac{1}{2}$', '$2-\\\\sqrt{2}$', '$1-\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{4}$', '$\\\\frac{2}{3}$']", "correct_answer": "C", "gpt_answer": "{\"selection\": \"None\"}", "response_history": "To solve this problem, we need to focus on the geometry of the square and the equilateral hexagon within it. The most relevant coordinates to consider are those that will help us determine the side length of the hexagon, which are the points of the hexagon itself. In the annotated image, these points correspond to the coordinates 1 (A), 3 (P), 8 (B), 11 (Q), 16 (C), 14 (R), 13 (D), and 9 (S).\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal, and we can use the properties of the square to find the side length. Let's consider the triangle APB. Since AP and PB are sides of the hexagon, they are both equal to s. The side AB of the square is equal to 1. Triangle APB is an isosceles right triangle because the square's sides are perpendicular. Therefore, the length of AP (which is s) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem for this 45-45-90 triangle:\n\n\\( AB^2 = AP^2 + PB^2 \\)\n\\( 1^2 = s^2 + s^2 \\)\n\\( 1 = 2s^2 \\)\n\\( s^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\\( s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} \\)\n\\( s = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\)\n\nHowever, we need to consider that the side length s of the hexagon is not the full length of the diagonal of the square but rather the length from point A to point P. Since the square's diagonal (from A to C) would be \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) (by the Pythagorean theorem for a square with side length 1), and the diagonal is composed of two lengths of s (from A to P and from P to C), we have:\n\n\\( \\sqrt{2} = 2s \\)\n\\( s = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\( s = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\)\n\nLooking at the options provided, none of them match this result exactly. However, we can simplify \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\) by multiplying the numerator and denominator by \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), which gives us:\n\n\\( s = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\)\n\nThis is equivalent to \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\), which is not one of the options provided. It seems there might be a mistake in the options or in the interpretation of the problem. If we consider the closest option to our result, it would be \\( 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\), which is not correct but is the closest to \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\). However, since none of the options match, we cannot select a correct answer from the list provided."}
